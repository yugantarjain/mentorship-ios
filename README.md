# Mentorship System (iOS)

[Mentorship System](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend) is an application that allows women in tech to mentor each other, on career development topics, through 1:1 relations for a certain period.

This is the iOS client for the Mentorship System.

## Setting up the project

1. Make sure you have Xcode IDE downloaded on your machine for development.<br />
2. Fork the project. Go to [mentorship-ios](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-ios) and click on Fork in the top right corner to fork the repository to your Github account.<br />
3. Clone the project. Open the forked mentorship-ios repository from your GitHub account and click on the "Clone or Download" button. You should be able to see the option "Open in Xcode"; this is the recommended option and should be used to get a local copy of the project on your machine.<br />
4. Open your terminal and go to the project folder on your machine. Run the command `pod install` (note: you may first need to install cocoapods using `sudo gem install cocoapods`). A new .xcworkspace file shall be created.
4. You're all set now! Use the .xcworkspace file for development.<br />

## Setting up social sign-in (Optional)
The Mentorship iOS app currently supports two different social sign in providers - Apple and Google. 
The set-up for both of these is a little different and are explained below-
#### Set-up Sign in with Apple
1. You will need an Apple Developer Account and the 'Account Holder' or 'Admin' rights for that account.
2. Add capability in Xcode project as explained [here](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/?lang=en#/devde676e696).
3. Register outbound email domain (mentorshiptest@mail.com) on your Apple Developer account. [Instructions](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/?lang=en#/devf822fb8fc)
#### Set-up Sign in with Google
1. Generate OAuth client id for project from [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start?ver=swift). You shall get a Configuration.plist file, save that for convenience.
2. Add reversed client id (from Configuration.plist file) as an URL type in Xcode project.
3. Add the client id in Config.plist file in the project for the key 'googleAuthClientId'.
4. To test Sign in with Google, you'll have to set-up the backend locally and use this same client-id as an environment variable. Please see the [instructions](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend) for setting up the backend locally.
